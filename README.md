### Background

Seraphic Fate is a storytelling webpage where users will input short story fragments into a visual interface and from it will come a picture. Using an academically sourced lexicon, lines of different colors and thicknesses will be drawn between different fragments inside a canvas so that users will have a unique piece of art to show the emotional flow of their story.

The story content processing will be done by <a href="http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">Mohammad Saif's crowdsourced lexicon</a>, and pictures will be drawn using <a href="https://github.com/evdel720/watercolor">Jangmi Jo's Water Colors API</a>.

### Technologies

This website was made entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are two main components, the lexicon processing logic, and the canvas and display logic.
